      <h2>Sc채b- Live Music</h2>
      <p class="Events_info">Dwayne Small, and his band Sc채b will be playing live music on  Friday August 7th. Sc채b traditionally plays Opera-Metal, but they are talented enough to play just about every genre, and very well. That is the long form of saying of course they take requests! Sc채b will be performing from 9PM-12 Midnight.</p>
      <h2>Previous Events</h2>
      <p class="Events_info">Netflix and Chill, July 31st- Big Mouth was streaming across all televisions, and our patrons laughter filled the restaurant! We hope to see you next time. (Content on these nights may not be suitable for children. Parental guidance may be necessary for patrons 18 and under.)
      Heckler's Paradise, July 24th- Half priced cocktails, and an open mic set up for amateur stand up comedy. The winner in this scenario? The audience of course! Those confident enough to take the stage told jokes to their fellow patrons, who were encouraged to clap back. This one was a night to remember, and will be making a return.</p>
