      <h1>Seven Principles of Typographic Contrast</h1>
      <p>In a seminal booklet that he both designed and wrote&#44; Carl Dair showed how in typography&#44; as in music&#44; harmony and contrast are the keys to composition&#46;</p>
      <h2 class=&#34;Author&#34;>Written by John D&#46; Berry</h2>
      <p>The late Canadian typographer Carl Dair was one of the great typographic designers of the 1950s and 1960s&#44; and he may have been the best of them all at explaining the nature of typography&#46; In coordinated projects that he both wrote and designed&#44; he managed to describe &#8209;&#8209; and show &#8209;&#8209; the ways in which manipulating and using type make typography happen&#46;</p>
      <p>Dair is the very epitome of what I mean when I say &#34;typographer&#34;&#58; someone who designs with type&#44; not just a fancy typesetter&#44; but someone who uses type&#44; in all its variations&#44; as the principle element of design&#46; Since type carries meaning&#44; the practice of typography requires a designer who cares about the words themselves&#46; It requires someone who cares enough&#44; and is skillful enough&#44; to make the type express that meaning&#44; rather than serve as simply eye&#8209;catching decoration&#46;</p>
      <p>Carl Dair&#39;s book &#34;Design With Type&#34; &#40;originally published in 1952&#59; revised and expanded in 1967&#41; is deservedly still in print&#44; even though the technology that he used and described has long been outdated&#46; The practicalities of setting type in metal are no longer the practicalities we have to deal with&#59; but the visual relationships between letters&#44; which Dair showed and explained so graphically in his book&#44; haven&#39;t changed at all&#46; &#34;Design With Type&#34; is still one of the best handbooks available for learning how to do exactly what the title says&#58; design with type&#46;</p>
      <p>At around the same time he was revising his book&#44; Carl Dair was producing a series of six pamphlets for West Virginia Pulp and Paper &#40;Westvaco&#41;&#44; which he called &#34;A Typographic Quest&#46;&#34; Each booklet was&#44; naturally&#44; printed on Westvaco paper stock; like the lavish paper&#8209;company samples produced today&#44; this series was meant to raise the profile of the manufacturer and encourage designers to think of Westvaco when specifying paper for their printing jobs&#46; But these were quite modest productions&#58; little saddlestitched booklets of about 30 pages&#44; measuring 5&#8209;1/4 inches by 9&#44; usually printed in two colors &#40;the first one uses three colors throughout&#59; the later ones are two&#8209;color&#44; although the second color may change from sheet to sheet&#44; with all three colors used together on the covers&#41;&#46; The first &#34;A Typographic Quest&#34; was published in 1964&#59; the sixth &#40;and&#44; as far as I know&#44; final&#41; came out in 1968&#44; the year Carl Dair died&#46; Since he was both writer and designer for the series&#44; each of the booklets emerged as a wholly crafted object&#44; dedicated to explaining one or another aspect of using type&#46;</p>
      <h3>Harmony and Contrast</h3>
      <p>The heart of Carl Dair&#39;s teaching &#8209;&#8209; the thing that I keep pointing people to&#44; and the most valuable thing I myself learned from his work &#8209;&#8209; is the subject of &#34;A Typographic Quest&#34; No&#46; 5&#58; &#34;Typographic Contrast&#46;&#34; In a virtuoso performance&#44; Dair shows exactly how designers use different kinds of visual contrast to make design work and meaning pop out &#8209;&#8209; clearly and unambiguously&#44; and with flair&#46; To make his point&#44; he compares typography to music&#46;</p>
      <p>Graphic form and musical form have a common denominator&#58; rhythm and emphasis&#44; harmony and contrast&#46; &#34;Harmony and contrast&#44;&#34; says Dair&#44; &#34;are fundamental to both&#44; and the discovery of these basic principles and their application to the design of printed matter is the object of this volume of &#39;A Typographic Quest&#46;&#39;&#34;</p>
      <h3>Seven Kinds of Contrast</h3>
      <p>Dair first explains the &#34;elements of harmony&#34; &#40;a consistent relationship between the black strokes of the letters on a page and the space around them&#59; and any rules&#44; frames&#44; or decorations being similar in style to the type&#41;&#44; then goes on to show seven different kinds of contrast&#46; He emphasizes that in any kind of differentiation&#44; it&#39;s important to make the contrast obvious &#8209;&#8209; not just a slight change&#44; an almost imperceptible variation&#44; but a really big&#44; obvious difference between the contrasting elements&#46;</p>

        <li>Contrast of Weight</li>

        <li>Contrast of Direction</li>
        <li>Other Types of Contrast</li>
        <li>Contrast of Size</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Contrast of Size</h4>
      <p>The first and most basic contrast is size&#46; &#34;A simple but dramatic contrast of size&#44;&#34; says Dair&#44; &#34;provides a point to which the reader&#39;s attention is drawn&#46; Set in the same style of type&#44; it maintains the exact relationship of the letter to the background&#46; It is only a physical enlargement of the basic pattern created by the form and the weight of the type being used for the text&#46;&#34; The most common use of size is in making the title or heading noticeably bigger than the text &#8209;&#8209; but that&#39;s only a starting&#8209;point&#46;</p>
      <h4>Contrast of Weight</h4>
      <p>The second most obvious contrast is of weight&#58; bold type stands out in the middle of lighter type of the same style&#46; As Dair points out&#44; &#34;Not only types of varying weight&#44; but other typographic material such as rules&#44; spots&#44; squares&#44; etc&#46;&#44; can be called into service to provide a heavy area for a powerful point of visual attraction or emphasis&#46;&#34;</p>
      <p>The next two kinds of contrast are the contrast of form and the contrast of structure&#46; It&#39;s not entirely obvious where to draw a line between these two&#44; since they both have to do with the shapes of the letters&#46;</p>
      <h4>Contrast of Form</h4>
      <p>By &#34;form&#44;&#34; Dair means the distinction between a capital letter and its lowercase equivalent&#44; or a roman letter and its italic variant&#46; He includes condensed and expanded versions under &#34;form&#44;&#34; and he even allows as how &#34;there are some script types which harmonize with standard types&#44; such as the Bank Script and Bodoni on the opposite page&#44; and can be used for dramatic change of form&#46;&#34; &#40;He warns&#44; parenthetically&#44; against using scripts and italics together&#44; since they are both versions of handwritten letters; they&#39;re more likely to conflict than to contrast&#46;&#41;</p>
      <h4>Contrast of Structure</h4>
      <p>By &#34;structure&#44;&#34; Dair means the different letterforms of different kinds of typefaces &#8209;&#8209; a monoline sans serif vs&#46; a high&#8209;contrast modern&#44; for instance&#44; or an italic vs&#46; a blackletter&#46; &#34;The use of contrast of structure may be compared to an orator who changes his voice not to increase or decrease the volume&#44; but to change the very quality of his voice to suit his words&#46;&#34;</p>
      <h4>Contrast of Texture</h4>
      <p>Put all these things together&#44; and apply them to a block of text on a page&#44; and you come to the contrast of texture&#58; the way the lines of type look as a mass&#44; which depends partly on the letterforms themselves and partly on how they&#39;re arranged&#46; &#34;Like threads in cloth&#44;&#34; says Dair&#44; &#34;types form the fabric of our daily communication&#46;&#34;</p>
      <h4>Contrast of Color</h4>
      <p>Dair&#39;s sixth contrast is color &#8209;&#8209; and he warns that a second color is usually less emphatic than plain black on white &#40;or white on black&#41;&#44; so it&#39;s important to give careful thought to which element needs to be emphasized&#44; and to pay attention to the tonal values of the colors used&#46;</p>
      <h4>Contrast of Direction</h4>
      <p>The last of Dair&#39;s seven kinds of contrast is the contrast of direction&#58; the opposition between vertical and horizontal&#44; and the angles in between&#46; Turning one word on its side can have a dramatic effect on a layout&#46; But Dair points out that text blocks also have their vertical or horizontal aspects&#44; and mixing wide blocks of long lines with tall columns of short lines can also produce a contrast&#46;</p>
      <h3>Other Types of Contrast</h3>
      <p>There are other kinds of contrast&#44; less clearly dependent on the type itself&#46; Dair mentions &#34;contrast by isolation&#44;&#34; i&#46;e&#46;&#44; putting a word or phrase in an isolated position away from the other elements on the page&#44; to make it stand out&#46; &#40;I think of this as a contrast of position&#46;&#41; And he suggests other kinds of non&#8209;typographic contrast&#44; such as mixing paper stocks&#44; embossing&#44; and using contrasting matte or gloss inks&#46; He also points out that illustrations&#44; especially line art&#44; may be in harmony with the type on the same page or may contrast with it completely&#46;</p>
      <p>Finally&#44; Dair takes time to say a little about rhythm &#40;&#34;in typography&#44; it consists of intervals of space&#34;&#41; and about the power of &#34;interrupted rhythm&#34; &#40;&#34;the impact derives not from the fact that the unexpected happens&#44; but rather that the expected does not happen&#34;&#41;&#46;</p>
      <p>Most of the time&#44; we use more than one kind of contrast together&#44; in order to make the differences between visual elements even more obvious&#46; We can use all of Dair&#39;s seven kinds of contrast at once&#44; if we&#39;re skillful; he refers to this as typographic &#34;chords&#46;&#34; &#40;One of the chapter titles in &#34;Design With Type&#34; is &#34;Multiplying the Contrasts&#46;&#34;&#41; But breaking them down like this into simple oppositions makes it easier to use them consciously; it keeps us from getting our layouts all muddied up through trying to change too many things at once without thinking about what we&#39;re doing&#46; I&#39;ve found Carl Dair&#39;s analysis of typographic contrast &#8209;&#8209; and especially the visual flair with which he presents it &#8209;&#8209; an invaluable tool in the practice of graphic design&#46;</p>
